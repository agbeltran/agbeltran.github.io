permalink: /publication/2024-07-15-FOAM-FAIRmappings
excerpt: 'Mappings and crosswalks are key elements to ensure semantic interoperability as well as metadata and data integration between different information systems. Designing FAIR compliant systems requires making sure all the elements that constitute the systems are themselves FAIR to support
machine-actionability and automation. This paper describes the ongoing European and international effort to build a framework for FAIR Mappings and crosswalks. This framework aims to be generic enough to capture the diverse set of use cases and methodologies across domains and communities. It should be composed of a set of technical recommendations to aid compliance with FAIR principles, a set of models for machine actionable mappings and crosswalks as well as a practical framework with aligned good
practices to support the creation of mappings by scientific communities. Developed in the context of FAIR-IMPACT, a Horizon Europe project, this work will be pursued within a more international context as a Research Data Alliance Working Group.'
