title: "A Framework for Active DMPs in Photon and Neutron Science Large-Scale Facilities"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-22-FrameworkActiveDMPs
excerpt: 'In this paper, a framework and a system architecture are presented to support researchers in DMP creation and execution, with a focus on the generation of FAIR data. Using the research data lifecycle within Photon and Neutron analytical facilities as a detailed exemplar of this approach in practice, it shows how combining the creation of the DMP with the project management framework PMBOK makes it easier to integrate DMP creation within the researchers’ workflow and reuse pre-existing information within the research infrastructure and related project roles. The paper identifies requirements and introduces a lifecycle for pre-existing information that helps in automatic population of the DMP. This paper also discusses a data model for the reuse of pre-existing information. It shows possible approaches to support scientists through the (semi-)automation of the creation, execution, and use of a DMP and knowledge transfer. The approach is based on work within the PaNData ODI, ExPaNDS, and PaNOSC projects.'
