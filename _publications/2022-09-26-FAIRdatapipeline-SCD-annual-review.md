excerpt: 'COVID-19 was an event that marked a ‘before’ and ‘after’ in our lives. We will all remember
the days when daily statistics on positive cases, hospitalisations and fatalities were
reported in each region of the world, providing metrics on the looming situation. And
some of those statistics will continue to be collected for the foreseeable future.'
