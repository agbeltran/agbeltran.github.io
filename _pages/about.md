### Current Positions

- **Group Leader**, [Data & Software Engineering Group](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Software-Engineering-Group.aspx), [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/), [UK Science and Technology Facilities Council](https://stfc.ukri.org/)
  
  Since March 2020, I am the Data & Software Engineering Group Leader at the [Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/). STFC is part of [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/). I am leading the group, and our focus is around *data management projects*, which include the development of bespoke software systems to manage the experimental data produced by the large scale scientific facilities at STFC, and *software management*, which includes supporting the software development process. I am a member of the STFC Open Science Committee. 

- Chair of the International Advisory Board, [DAPHNE4NFDI](https://www.daphne4nfdi.de/) project. Funded as a part of the National Research Data Infrastructure Germany ([NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/)), DAPHNE4NFDI is a â‚¬15M project to develop state of the art data infrastructure for the photon and neutron science community. DAPHNE stands for DAta for PHoton and Neutron Experiments and addresses the desperate need for user-oriented tools to help users manage large datasets, from data collection through to analysis, publication and long-term archiving.

### Research & Development

Nowadays, all areas of science are dealing with unprecedented amounts of data, overwhelming our ability to organise, find, analyse, and store it. **Models**, **methods**, and **software tools** for data science and innovative scholarly communication are an absolute necessity for current research, and it is precisely this set of software tools, models and methods that I work on developing, with the aim of enabling **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable ([FAIR](https://agbeltran.github.io/publication/2016-03-15-fair-guiding-principles)) data**,  **research reproducibility** and **aggregation of research results**.
 
 
### Previous Positions 
  
In May 2019, I joined the Software Engineering Group at the [Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/) as the **Data Management Team Lead and Technical Architect**. STFC is part of [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/). I lead the technical aspects around the data management projects, which include the development of bespoke software systems to manage the experimental data produced by the large scale scientific facilities at STFC.

Until then, I was a **Research Lecturer** at the  [Oxford e-Research Centre](http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/) in the [Engineering Science](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk) Department of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) and member of [Congregation](https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/councilsec/governance/congregation/membership/). I was also a member of the [Engineering Science](http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) Researchers Committee. 

Before joining the **[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/)**, I was involved with the Computational and Systems Medicine project and the Department of Computer Science at **[University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk)**, collaborating, among others, with the [National Cancer Research Institute](https://www.ncri.org.uk/). I mainly worked on knowledge management for cancer research data. 

Before that, I completed a **PhD in Computer Science** at **[Queen's University Belfast](http://www.qub.ac.uk)**, UK, and a Licentiateship, which would be equivalent to an MSc, in Computer Science at **[Universidad Nacional de Rosario](https://www.unr.edu.ar/)**, Argentina. 
During my undergraduate studies, I worked on e-government and did a year in industry as a Software Engineer in Portugal.
