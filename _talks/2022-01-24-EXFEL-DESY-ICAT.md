I was invited to give a talk in the session "DAPHNE4NFDI: Science driven data management solutions for the user community", one of the [satellite meetings](https://indico.desy.de/event/32411/page/3965-satellite-meetings) within the [European XFEL Users' Meeting 2022, DESY Photon Science Users Meeting 2022](https://indico.desy.de/event/32411/).

The [programme](https://indico.desy.de/event/32411/attachments/70915/90748/DAPHNE_WS.pdf) of the session covered an introduction to the [DAPHNE4NFDI](https://www.daphne4nfdi.de/) project and multiple talks on standards under development, electronic lab notebooks, data catalogue solutions and multiple algorithms.

I presented in the [ICAT project](https://icatproject.org/), and my talk was entitled: "The ICAT project: A modular ecosystem of tools for large-scale facilities data management". My slides are available in Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6401156](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6401156)
