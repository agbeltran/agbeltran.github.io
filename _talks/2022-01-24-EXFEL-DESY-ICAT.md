I was invited to give a talk in the session "DAPHNE4NFDI: Science driven data management solutions for the user community" within the European XFEL Users' Meeting 2022 | DESY Photon Science Users' Meeting 2022.

The [programme](https://indico.desy.de/event/32411/attachments/70915/90748/DAPHNE_WS.pdf) of the session covered an introduction to the DAPHNE4NFDI project and multiple talks on standards under development, electronic lab notebooks, data catalogue solutions and multiple algorithms.

I presented in the ICAT project, and my talk was entitled: "The ICAT project: A modular ecosystem of tools for large-scale facilities data management".
