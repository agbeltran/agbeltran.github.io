I was invited to present in the [CECAM](https://www.cecam.org/) workshop on "Machine actionable data for chemical sciences: Bridging experiments, simulations, and machine learning for spectral data" ([MADICES](https://madices.github.io/)), which took place online from 7th to 9th February 2022. 

My presentation was entitled "Towards FAIR research data management" and I talked about a few of the projects I am working on to help make the data more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.
