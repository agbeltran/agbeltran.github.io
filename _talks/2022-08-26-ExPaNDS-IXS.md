I was an invited speaker to the 12th International Conference on Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS 2022), which was held on Oxford, UK.

I talked about the [European Union Horizon 2020 ExPANDS project](https://expands.eu/), and the title of the talk was "ExPaNDS - Towards FAIR and open photon and neutron data".
