I was an invited speaker to the [12th International Conference on Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS 2022)](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Events/2022/Inelastic-X-Ray-Scattering-Conference-2021.html), which was held on Oxford, UK in August 2022.

I talked about the [European Union Horizon 2020 ExPANDS project](https://expands.eu/), and the title of the talk was "ExPaNDS - Towards FAIR and open photon and neutron data".
