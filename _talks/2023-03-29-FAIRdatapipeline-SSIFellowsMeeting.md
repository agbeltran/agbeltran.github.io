The Software Sustainability Institute Fellows Community meet regularly to share activities and opportunities, and discuss topics of interest.

I provided an update on the FAIR data pipeline to the SSI Fellows Community Call from March 2023.

The calls updates are summarised in the Fellows Newsletter, and you can read the [April 2023 edition here](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/fellows-newsletter-april-2023).

The [slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7818166) are available in Zenodo, and the presentation was recorded and it is available in the [SSI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQcXOwo4QWI).
