Peter Winstanley from Semantics Arts and I were invited to give a talk for the FAIRsFAIR webinar on "Using DCAT (Data Catalogue Vocabulary) to support metadata catalogue integration". We gave an introduction on the [DCAT](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/) vocabulary, described its evolution and gave an overview on the initial steps to implement it. 

The details of the webinar can be found [here](https://www.fairsfair.eu/events/webinar-series/using-dcat-data-catalogue-vocabulary-support-metadata-catalogue-integration).

The slides are available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6142906).
