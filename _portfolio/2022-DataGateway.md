Since joining [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) on May 2019, I have led the project meant to provide a user-friendly web-based user interface for supporting to **browse**, **explore** and **visualise** the experimental data produced by large-scale facilities.

Large scale facilities, such as synchrotrons, neutron and muon sources, lasers and accelerators, generate vast amounts of data that need to be managed in an efficient way, supporting data ingestion for long-term storage and archival, as well as data analysis and data publication workflows.

**DataGateway** focuses on providing data discovery and data access functionality to the data.

The project involves multiple modules available on GitHub.

The web application is in production for the [ISIS Data Catalogue](https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/) and the Diamond Data Catalogue.
